# WhenInMyTime - Instant Time Zone Converter

WhenInMyTime is a sleek and intuitive web application that allows you to instantly convert any date and time to your local time zone. Simply enter a natural language date, like “tomorrow at 3pm PT,” and see the result in your own time zone, along with the time remaining.

## About The Project

WhenInMyTime was built to solve a common problem for people who work in distributed teams or have friends and family in different time zones. The goal was to create a simple, user-friendly tool that could quickly and accurately convert any time to the user’s local time, without the need for a complex interface or manual time zone selection.

### Key Features

*   **Natural Language Processing**: Understands human-readable dates and times (e.g., “next Friday at 5pm”).
*   **Instant Conversion**: Automatically detects your local time zone and displays the converted time instantly.
*   **Time Remaining**: Shows the time remaining until the specified date and time.
*   **Clickable Examples**: Provides a list of examples that can be clicked to instantly see the conversion.
*   **Responsive Design**: A clean and modern UI that works seamlessly on all devices.
